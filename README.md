# gatsby-plugin-bch-tx-history

This is a very simple Gastby Plugin that is intended to be used with the [bch-wallet-starter](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-starter) Gatsby Site. This plugin is intended more as a demonstration of how to create a plugin that makes use of [component extension](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/theme-api/#extending), than it is serious attempt to create a useful plugin.

This plugin contains a component that displays the transaction history for a Bitcoin Cash address.
